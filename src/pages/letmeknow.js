                <br/>
                <p>However, sometimes, there are people out there that (perish the thought!) enjoy watching EG lose and tell me to update the site when EG drop the most minor of networth leads.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>With that in mind, it'd be much appreciated if you could give me a win probability graph or a Twitch clip when you let me know. Thanks!</p>
